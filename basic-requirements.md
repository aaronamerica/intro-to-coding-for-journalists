# Basic Requirements For This Course

This course requires you to have a working development environment on your own machine.

A 'development environment' is a set of tools a programmer uses to write and deploy code.

## Operating Systems

Instructions for this course are written for MacOS. We currently have limited support for Windows or Linux, and you may need to do your own Googling to set up your environment. I strongly recommend that you update your operating system before installing the tools listed below.

## Tools

Please set up accounts/install the tools in the order listed below.

### Github

We will use Github to store and share code during this course. You will need a free
Github account, which you can sign up for at [Github.com](github.com).

## git

We will use git as our version control system. You can download and install git here: [Installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).Depending on what you already have installed, you may have to install dependencies. Git may require you to download XCode, but it will prompt you to do so if you need it.

## npm

We will use npm as our package manager. Install `npm` using the instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Atom

Atom is an open-source programmers' editor that we use in this class. It is free and you can download it here: https://atom.io/

## Terminal

Terminal comes with your Mac, but you do need to know how to find it and use it. You will be using it from the very first day in class. You can find Terminal in /Applications/Utilities. If you have never seen Terminal before, or used command-line applications, I strongly recommend you read this and try the exercises out on  your own laptop: [How to use Terminal on the Mac when you have no idea where to start](https://www.imore.com/how-use-terminal-mac-when-you-have-no-idea-where-start).

*For Windows*

The built in Terminal for Windows is not so great. Consider using [PowerShell].
