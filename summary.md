# Intro to Coding For Journalists

* [Basic Requirements for This Course](basic-requirements.md)

* [Week One: Why Code?/The Development Environment](week1.md)


* [Week Two: Version Control: Git, Github](week2.md)

We introduce version control -- a core aspect of coding and collaborating. We connect to code repositories maintained by The New York Times, Washington Post, and The Guardian and 'clone' those onto our own machines.

* [Week Three: Bootstrap and Flat File Websites](week3.md)

We use Bootstrap -- a template language developed by Twitter -- to create a template for a simple flat-file website, which we store and host on Github. (Builds on the HTML/CSS lessons from 550 and 704)

* Week Four: Javascript: The D3.js Library Introduction

We introduce Javascript concepts and begin using D3.js, a library created by Mike Bostock to do election data visualizations for the New York Times. D3.js has now become the dominant web-ready data visualization library. We also do a 'tour' of state of the art data visualizations from newsrooms.

* Week Five: Javascript: Using D3.js To Build Data Visualizations

We build a simple Javascript data visualization using D3.js.  (Builds on, but doesn't require, skills learned in Prof. Mulvihill and Prof. Brooke Williams' classes).

* Week Six: Serving Data Visualizations to the Web

We will use the simple flat-file website we built in Week Three to 'host' our data visualization.  Reviews key development skills such as using a local webserver to test our work, and then 'pushing' it live to the web using version control tools.

* Week Seven: Javascript: More Complex Data Visualizations

We take the basic D3 skills we have learned and, like art students, 'copy' a data visualization done by The Washington Post, and push it live to our own websites.

We also preview an app template -- either The Washington Post's Kyt or the NPR App Template, which will be used for a group project

* Week Eight: Project Planning & Collaboration

Practicing all of these skills in a real newsroom environment means having excellent project management and collaboration skills. We learn basic aspects of the Agile tech project management methodology, learn how to build and manage a project card board, and practice splitting up projects, doing tasks, and merging and launching code when it's from multiple team members. Students pitch a team project.

* Week Nine: App Framework/App Templates

We will get a basic web app running during this class using an app template created for use in a newsroom environment (WaPo's Kyt, or the NPR App Template). We'll use a simple list-search-sort app using data on police shootings.

* Week Ten: App Framework Hosting

We go over how to 'push' your app live on the web using free app hosting platforms like Heroku.

* Week Eleven and Twelve: Project Workshop

Students will work together in teams and address issues they have encountered with their projects.

* Week Thirteen: Project Presentation & Final Pull Requests

Students give a live presentation of their app and do a final 'pull request' on the news organization's repository, letting them know a student team has built an app with the app template they developed.
