# Intro To Coding for Journalists: Self-Guided Tips

If you are working through this course as a self-guided learner, welcome and thank you! Here are a few recommendations on how to work your way through this material.

## What Will I Learn?

The goal of this course is for students to be able to spin up immersive, scrollable story sites, complete with interactive data visualizations, using modern development tools and Javascript.

For students doing this course in-person, there are a number of learning objectives. As a self-guided learner, you should be able to do all these things if you do the readings, quizzes, and actually do the assignments.

* Become comfortable with the command line -- managing files, making commands, and using command line tools like `git`, `npm`, and `grunt`.
* Understand and be able to use version control tools, in particular, `git` and Github.
* Use a text editor to edit and manage code.
* Be able to spin up and edit a simple flat-file website using Bootstrap, and make it available on the web.
* Learn computer programming basics -- variables, arrays, functions -- as part of our work. In this case, we learn those basics in the context of the Javascript programming language.
* Use two Javascript libraries (prewritten stacks of code): D3.js, a library that allows us to make interactive data visualizations, and Scrollmagic.js, a library that allows us to make immersive, scrollable interactive feature packages.

In-person students for this class have a final project: they do a reported story, and then build an immersive, scrolling site to contain it, and it must contain at least one interactive data visualization that they code themselves. Whether you do that -- that's up to you! We hope you will use these skills in your work as a storyteller/journalist.

## Will I Need To Spend Any Money?

Not on software. But you will need a copy of our textbook, Scott Murray's [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Web-Introduction/dp/1491921285/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), which is available on Amazon.

## Recommendations

### Basic Requirements

In order to complete the activities in this course, you will have to install the software we use to do the assignments, which you can find listed at [Basic Requirements](basic-requirements.md).

### Start Here

Start with this self-assessment: [Intro to Coding for Journalist Skills Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTTlIj_aQ0yp9NFLXKr5xMXPpLFxbz0OzamPcYWTyU7698xQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Once you're done with that, install the tools listed in [Basic Requirements](basic-requirements.md) and visit the [course outline](README.md). Start with [Week 1: Why Code?/The Development Environment](https://github.com/fullstackjournalists/intro-to-coding-for-journalists/blob/master/README.md#week-one-why-codethe-development-environment). Each week has a similar structure:

* Readings
* Diagnostic
* Lab
* Assignment

Start with the readings. Then visit the linked "lab" page for that week and follow the instructions. Some weeks have a diagnostic (quiz), usually to be completed before you do the lab. Complete the diagnostic before moving on to the lab unless the lab instructions tell you otherwise. At the end of the lab, there will be an assignment for you to work on independently.

At this writing, we have only released the full course material for Weeks 1-3. Keep an eye on the repository for more lessons to drop!

### Do The Reading!

**The readings are not optional.** Ya gotta read the book! You won't be able to finish the lab or assignments -- and you won't pick up the skills -- unless you do the readings, particularly the ones in the assigned text. You need them to actually get through this course and learn what's being taught here.

### Do The Diagnostics!

Sure, you could skip the quizzes. But you're really shorting yourself if you do.

### Make Pull Requests!

Many of the assignments ask you to make 'pull requests.' That means that when you finish your work on your laptop, you'll be making a notification on our repository here that we can see. Please do this -- it's like saying hi, and we would love to wave back.
